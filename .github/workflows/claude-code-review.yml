            Review this YDB Embedded UI pull request focusing on:

            1. **Code Standards**:
               - TypeScript type safety and proper interface usage (prefixed with 'T')
               - React best practices and Gravity UI component usage
               - Redux Toolkit patterns with RTK Query
               - BEM naming convention with cn() utility

            2. **Critical Requirements**:
               - All user-facing text must use i18n (no hardcoded strings)
               - API calls must go through window.api, never direct calls
               - No state mutations in RTK Query
               - Route params validation (React Router v5)

            3. **Performance & Security**:
               - Virtual scrolling for large tables (PaginatedTable)
               - React.memo for expensive renders
               - No exposed secrets or keys
               - Proper error handling and loading states

            4. **Testing**:
               - Unit tests in __test__ directories
               - E2E tests follow page object pattern

            Be constructive and reference specific files with file_path:line_number format.
