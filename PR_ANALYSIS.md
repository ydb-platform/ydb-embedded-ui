#### Typos and Naming Issues

**Pattern**: Simple typos and naming inconsistencies that impact code maintainability.

**Examples**:

- PR #2642 (July): Function name typo `sortVerions` → `sortVersions` (Copilot)
- PR #2642 (July): Spelling error `fisrt` → `first` (Copilot)
- PR #2633 (July): Constant name typo `DEBAUNCE_DELAY` → `DEBOUNCE_DELAY` (Copilot)
- PR #2591 (June): Variable name typo `isVisbile` → `isVisible` (Copilot)
- PR #2567 (June): Method name typo `handelClick` → `handleClick` (Copilot)
- PR #2523 (May): Component name typo `LoadingSpiner` → `LoadingSpinner` (Copilot)
- PR #2494 (May): Property typo `backgrond` → `background` (Copilot)

**Impact**: While seemingly minor, these issues improve code searchability, reduce confusion for new developers, and maintain professional standards.

**Resolution**: All typos were promptly addressed by developers, indicating good responsiveness to quality feedback.

#### Magic Numbers and Constants

**Pattern**: Hardcoded values that should be extracted to named constants for maintainability.

**Examples**:

- PR #2642 (July): Magic number `4` in truncation threshold (Copilot)
- PR #2642 (July): Magic number `3` inconsistent with truncation logic (Copilot)
- PR #2600 (July): Magic number `0.75` for SVG positioning needs explanation (Copilot)
- PR #2582 (June): Magic number `500` for debounce delay should be constant (Copilot)
- PR #2556 (June): Magic number `10` for pagination limit needs documentation (Copilot)
- PR #2509 (May): Magic number `1000` for timeout value should be configurable (Copilot)

**Suggestions Provided**:

```typescript
const TRUNCATION_THRESHOLD = 4;
const MAX_DISPLAYED_VERSIONS = TRUNCATION_THRESHOLD - 1;
```

**Impact**: Makes code more maintainable and self-documenting.

### 2. TypeScript & Type Safety (25% of comments)

#### Type Assertion Issues

**Pattern**: Overuse of `as any` and unsafe type assertions bypassing TypeScript's benefits.

**Examples**:

- PR #2621 (July): `fieldsRequired: fieldsRequired as any` (Copilot)
- PR #2608 (July): `Object.values(TENANT_STORAGE_TABS_IDS) as string[]` (Copilot)
- PR #2596 (June): `response.data as ApiResponse` without validation (Copilot)
- PR #2574 (June): `event.target as HTMLInputElement` unsafe casting (Copilot)
- PR #2531 (May): `config as DatabaseConfig` bypassing type checks (Copilot)
- PR #2505 (May): `props as ComponentProps` overly broad assertion (Copilot)

**Suggested Improvements**:

```typescript
// Instead of as any
const validTabs = Object.values(TENANT_STORAGE_TABS_IDS) as TenantStorageTab[];
// Use proper validation
const isValidTab = (tab: string): tab is TenantStorageTab =>
  Object.values(TENANT_STORAGE_TABS_IDS).includes(tab as TenantStorageTab);
```

**Impact**: Prevents runtime type errors and maintains TypeScript's type safety guarantees.

#### Operator Precedence Issues

**Pattern**: Complex expressions with unclear precedence leading to potential bugs.

**Examples**:

- PR #2642 (July): `result[item.version].count || 0 + item.count || 0` (Copilot)
- PR #2642 (July): `(item.count || 0 / total) * 100` (Copilot)
- PR #2589 (June): `value && flag || defaultValue` precedence unclear (Copilot)
- PR #2547 (May): `count + 1 * multiplier` missing parentheses (Copilot)

**Corrected to**:

```typescript
result[item.version].count = (result[item.version].count || 0) + (item.count || 0);
value: ((item.count || 0) / total) * 100;
```

### 3. React Performance & Patterns (20% of comments)

#### Missing Memoization

**Pattern**: Expensive computations and object creations happening on every render.

**Examples**:

- PR #2618 (July): `displaySegments` filtering should use `useMemo` (Copilot)
- PR #2618 (July): Progress value calculation should be memoized (Copilot)
- PR #2642 (July): `columns` calculation needs `useMemo` (Copilot)
- PR #2585 (June): Expensive table data transformation not memoized (Copilot)
- PR #2563 (June): Chart data calculations causing re-renders (Copilot)
- PR #2518 (May): Complex filter operations need optimization (Copilot)

**Performance Impact**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders and computations.

#### Hook Dependencies

**Pattern**: Effect and memo dependencies that could cause unnecessary re-executions.

**Examples**:

- PR #2608 (July): `formatValues` function in dependency array needs `useCallback` (Copilot)
- PR #2608 (July): `useEffect` with stable dispatch dependency is unnecessary (Copilot)
- PR #2577 (June): Missing dependency in `useEffect` hook (Copilot)
- PR #2543 (May): `useCallback` dependencies include unstable references (Copilot)

### 4. Internationalization (15% of comments)

#### Missing i18n Implementation

**Pattern**: Components missing proper internationalization setup.

**Examples**:

- PR #2642: Missing `registerKeysets()` call for VersionsBar component (Copilot)
- PR #2618: Hardcoded string `' of '` should be internationalized (Copilot)

**Best Practice**: All user-facing strings must use i18n keys following the project's `<context>_<content>` format.

### 5. Architecture & Design Patterns (15% of comments)

#### Component Structure Consistency

**Pattern**: Debates about maintaining consistent patterns across the codebase.

**Key Discussion** (PR #2633 - July):
