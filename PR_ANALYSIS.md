Great performance improvement! Consider using React.memo for the TableRow component to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Also, you might want to implement shouldComponentUpdate for class components.

The virtualization looks good, but have you considered using react-window instead of react-virtualized? It has better performance and smaller bundle size. Also consider implementing proper error boundaries.

2. **developer1**: I looked into react-window but decided to stick with react-virtualized for consistency. We can migrate later. Added error boundaries as suggested.
