# Usage Instructions for PR Comment Analysis

## Overview
This project contains automated scripts to analyze pull request comments and identify valuable feedback patterns for code quality improvement.

## Files
- `analyze-pr-comments.js` - Core analysis logic and comment classification
- `run-pr-analysis.js` - Main script that fetches data and generates reports
- `PR_ANALYSIS.md` - Generated analysis report (created when scripts run)

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated (optional, will use mock data if not available)

### Running the Analysis

```bash
# Run the complete analysis
node run-pr-analysis.js

# Or run the core logic tests
node analyze-pr-comments.js
```

### Configuration
The script analyzes PRs from the last 3 months by default. To change this:
1. Edit the `threeMonthsAgo.setMonth()` calculation in `analyze-pr-comments.js`
2. Or modify the `dateFilter` variable

### Output
The script generates `PR_ANALYSIS.md` with:
- Summary statistics by suggestion type and implementation status
- Detailed analysis of each valuable comment
- Discussion threads and outcomes
- Code context and file references

## Comment Classification
Comments are classified as valuable if they contain:
- Code quality suggestions (refactoring, optimization, etc.)
- Security or performance concerns
- Testing or documentation improvements
- Architecture or design discussions
- Technical implementation feedback

## Implementation Status Detection
The script automatically determines if suggestions were:
- **Implemented**: Based on follow-up comments indicating resolution
- **Rejected**: Based on disagreement or explicit rejection
- **Pending**: Still under discussion or unresolved
- **Likely Implemented**: PR was merged without explicit resolution
- **Abandoned**: PR was closed without merging
