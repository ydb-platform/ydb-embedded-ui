# YDB Embedded UI - Actionable Development Guidelines

Based on analysis of 435 PR comments

## Quick Reference Card

### Before You Code:

- [ ] Check if similar component exists in `src/components/`
- [ ] Verify Gravity UI has the component you need
- [ ] Look for existing API patterns in `src/services/api/`

### While Coding:

- [ ] All strings use i18n: `i18n('context_text')`
- [ ] API calls use `window.api.module.method()`
- [ ] Types prefixed with 'T' for API types
- [ ] Components use `const b = cn('component-name')`
- [ ] Loading states handled with `<Loader />`
- [ ] Error states show `<ResponseError error={error} />`

### Before Committing:

- [ ] Run `npm run lint`
- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Add tests for new features
- [ ] PR title: `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`

## Detailed Guidelines by Category

### CodeImprovements

- 1. **CSS Variable Addition** (src/containers/App/App.scss:33-37)
  ```css
  --diagnostics-section-title-margin: 20px;
  --diagnostics-section-margin: 30px;
  --diagnostics-section-table-width: 100%;
  ```
  These new CSS variables are added but I don't see them being used in the changed files. Consider removing if unused or documenting their purpose.

2. (1 occurrences)

- 3. **Performance Considerations**
  - All tables continue to use `ResizeableDataTable` which supports virtual scrolling âœ…
  - Proper use of `React.useMemo` for column definitions in TopTables.tsx:56 âœ…
  - Auto-refresh patterns maintained correctly

4. (1 occurrences)

- 1. **Branch targeting**: Both workflows will run on all PR branches. Consider restricting to specific branches if needed:
  ```yaml
  on:
    pull_request:
      branches: [main, develop] (1 occurrences)
  ```
- 1. **Typo in constant name** (src/utils/hooks/useScrollPosition.ts:6):
  ```typescript
  const DEBAUNCE_DELAY = 100; // Should be DEBOUNCE_DELAY
  ```

2. (1 occurrences)

- 3. **Console warnings not internationalized** (src/utils/hooks/useScrollPosition.ts:27,39,59):
  - Console warnings are developer-facing and don't need i18n, but consider if these should be in production code at all.

4. (1 occurrences)

### NamingConventions

- these should be in (1 occurrences)
- `DEBAUNCE_DELAY` â†’ `DEBOUNCE_DELAY` (1 occurrences)
- warnings should be in (1 occurrences)
- and should be avoided (1 occurrences)
- it should be named (1 occurrences)

### ReactPatterns

- React hooks (55 occurrences)

### TestingPatterns

- storage-label')
  : i18n('context_storage-groups', {count: storageGroupCount})
  }

```

### âœ… Code Standards Compliance

- **TypeScript**: Type safety is maintained throughout the changes
- **i18n**: All user-facing strings use the i18n system correctly
- **API Patterns**: Follows the RTK Query pattern with proper hooks
- **React Patterns**: Uses hooks appropriately and maintains component purity
- **BEM Naming**: CSS classes follow the BEM convention with cn() utility
