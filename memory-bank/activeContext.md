# Active Context: Pagination Implementation

## Current Focus

The current focus is on understanding and documenting the pagination mechanism implemented in the YDB Embedded UI project, specifically the `PaginatedTable` component and its related files.

### Key Components

1. **PaginatedTable.tsx** - Main component that orchestrates the pagination
2. **useScrollBasedChunks.ts** - Custom hook that determines which chunks are active based on scroll position
3. **TableChunk.tsx** - Component that renders a chunk of data and manages its loading state
4. **TableRow.tsx** - Component that renders individual table rows
5. **types.ts** - Type definitions for the pagination components
6. **constants.ts** - Constants used throughout the pagination implementation

## Recent Changes

N/A - This is the initial documentation of the pagination implementation.

## Open Questions/Issues

1. How does the pagination implementation handle very large datasets (10,000+ rows)?
2. Are there any performance optimizations that could be applied to the current implementation?
3. How does the pagination interact with filtering and sorting?
4. How could this implementation be improved for accessibility?
