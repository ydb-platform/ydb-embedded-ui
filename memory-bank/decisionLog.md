# Decision Log: Pagination Implementation

## [2025-04-27 13:47:10] - Pure Chunk-Based Virtualization Approach

**Decision**: The pagination system implements purely chunk-based virtualization without any row-based virtualization.

**Context**: In web UI development, there are common approaches to efficiently rendering large datasets:

- Chunk-based virtualization (implemented in this project): Only rendering chunks of rows that are visible
- Row-based virtualization (alternative approach, not implemented): Selectively rendering individual rows based on visibility

**Analysis of Current Implementation**:
The implementation uses exclusively chunk-based virtualization:

- In `useScrollBasedChunks.ts`, the calculations only determine which chunks are visible:

  ```typescript
  // Lines 49-53
  const start = Math.max(Math.floor(visibleStart / rowHeight / chunkSize) - overscanCount, 0);
  const end = Math.min(
    Math.floor(visibleEnd / rowHeight / chunkSize) + overscanCount,
    Math.max(chunksCount - 1, 0),
  );
  ```

- In `TableChunk.tsx`, when a chunk is active, it renders ALL rows in that chunk:

  ```typescript
  // Lines 136-144
  return currentData.data.map((rowData, index) => (
      <TableRow
          key={index}
          row={rowData as T}
          columns={columns}
          height={rowHeight}
          getRowClassName={getRowClassName}
      />
  ));
  ```

- There is no code that selectively renders individual rows based on their visibility

**Rationale**:

- Simpler implementation and maintenance
- More efficient data fetching by requesting groups of rows at once
- Better compatibility with standard HTML table structure
- Reduced complexity in handling scroll events

**Implications**:

- All rows in an active chunk are rendered, even if only some are visible
- Works well for moderate-sized chunks but may be less optimal for very large chunks

## [2025-04-27 13:47:10] - Custom Hook for Scroll Tracking

**Decision**: Implemented scroll tracking logic in a separate custom hook (`useScrollBasedChunks`).

**Context**: The pagination system needs to track scroll position to determine which chunks should be rendered.

**Rationale**:

- Separation of concerns: Isolates scroll tracking logic from rendering logic
- Reusability: The hook can be used in different table implementations
- Testability: Makes it easier to test the scroll tracking logic independently
- Maintainability: Simplifies the main component by extracting complex logic

**Implications**:

- Requires careful management of dependencies and re-renders
- Introduces a level of indirection that might make the code flow harder to follow

## [2025-04-27 13:47:10] - Independent Chunk Loading

**Decision**: Each chunk independently manages its own loading state and data fetching.

**Context**: When scrolling through a large dataset, multiple chunks may need to be loaded at different times.

**Rationale**:

- Parallel loading: Multiple chunks can load simultaneously
- Fault isolation: Errors in one chunk don't affect others
- Progressive rendering: Chunks can render as soon as their data is available
- Better user experience: Visible parts of the table appear faster

**Implications**:

- Requires careful management of API requests to avoid overwhelming the server
- May result in duplicated requests if not properly integrated with a caching mechanism
- Needs proper error handling at the chunk level

## [2025-04-27 13:47:10] - RTK Query Integration

**Decision**: Use Redux Toolkit Query for data fetching in chunks.

**Context**: The pagination system needs to fetch data for each chunk efficiently.

**Rationale**:

- Built-in caching: Avoids duplicate requests for the same data
- Automatic refetching: Supports automatic refresh intervals
- Loading and error states: Provides standardized ways to track loading and error states
- Cancellation: Supports cancelling requests when components unmount

**Implications**:

- Creates a dependency on Redux and RTK Query
- Requires proper configuration of query parameters for efficient caching
- Adds complexity to the application's state management
