# Product Context: YDB Embedded UI Pagination

## Overview

The YDB Embedded UI is a web interface for managing and interacting with YDB (Yandex Database) instances. As a database management tool, it frequently needs to display large datasets such as tables with thousands of rows, query results, logs, and other paginated information.

## Pagination Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **Performance**: Must efficiently handle large datasets (potentially thousands of rows) without degrading UI responsiveness
2. **Progressive Loading**: Should load data incrementally as needed, rather than all at once
3. **Smooth Scrolling**: Should provide a smooth scrolling experience without visible jumps or layout shifts
4. **Error Resilience**: Should handle fetch errors gracefully and allow for retries
5. **Visual Feedback**: Should provide clear loading states and empty states

### User Experience Considerations

1. **Familiar Interface**: Should feel like a standard table with traditional scrolling behavior
2. **Responsive**: Should adapt to different screen sizes and container dimensions
3. **Sortable Columns**: Should support sorting data by different columns
4. **Filterable Data**: Should support filtering data based on various criteria
5. **Accessibility**: Should be usable with keyboard navigation and screen readers

## Technical Context

The pagination system is used across multiple areas of the application where large datasets need to be displayed:

1. Database tables and query results
2. Logs and diagnostic information
3. Monitoring data and metrics
4. Configuration and settings listings

The implementation needs to work well with the React-based frontend architecture and integrate with the application's data fetching mechanisms, state management (Redux), and UI component library.

## Related Systems

- **Data Fetching**: Integrates with RTK Query for API requests
- **State Management**: Uses Redux for state management
- **UI Components**: Built on the project's component library
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Works with the application's filtering and sorting mechanisms
