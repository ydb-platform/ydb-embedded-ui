# Progress Log: Pagination Analysis

## Analysis and Documentation Progress

### [2025-04-27 13:51:05] - Initial Analysis of PaginatedTable Components

**Status**: Completed

**Tasks Completed**:

- Analyzed core pagination components:
  - PaginatedTable.tsx
  - TableChunk.tsx
  - TableRow.tsx
  - useScrollBasedChunks.ts
  - constants.ts
  - types.ts
- Documented the main pagination patterns in systemPatterns.md
- Created product context documentation in productContext.md
- Documented key architectural decisions in decisionLog.md

**Key Findings**:

- The pagination implementation uses a chunk-based virtualization approach
- Each chunk manages its own loading state and data fetching
- The system efficiently handles large datasets by only rendering visible chunks
- Integration with RTK Query provides caching and automatic refetching
- The implementation includes proper error handling at the chunk level

**Future Work**:

- Consider performance testing with very large datasets (10,000+ rows)
- Explore accessibility improvements for the pagination implementation
- Investigate how the pagination implementation interacts with filtering and sorting
- Document best practices for component customization and extension

## Current Status

The memory bank for the pagination implementation is now established with comprehensive documentation of:

- The product context and requirements (productContext.md)
- The system patterns and architecture (systemPatterns.md)
- Key architectural decisions and their rationale (decisionLog.md)
- Progress tracking and future work (progress.md)

This documentation provides a solid foundation for understanding, maintaining, and potentially enhancing the pagination implementation in the YDB Embedded UI.
